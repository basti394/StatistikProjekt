    "# Deep Dive: Stability Risks & System Rivalry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "In our previous analyses, we established two key findings:\n",
    "1.  **Notebook 2:** China grows significantly faster but exhibits higher variance (wider Confidence Intervals).\n",
    "2.  **Notebook 3:** China's market mechanisms (Phillips Curve, Okun's Law) differ structurally from Western economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final analytical chapter, we aim to validate these findings using specific hypothesis tests that focus on **stability risks** and a direct **head-to-head comparison** of the two superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "1.  **The Volatility Hypothesis (Chi-Square):** Does the higher variance in China translate into a significantly higher frequency of \"Boom/Bust\" years compared to the stable Swiss economy?\n",
    "2.  **The Superpower Hypothesis (t-Test):** Is there a significant difference in the inflation pressure between the two largest economies, the **USA and China**, or do they face similar monetary challenges despite their structural differences?"

    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "1.  **Growth & Volatility:** We confirmed that China operates in a high-growth but high-variance regime. The Chi-Square test reinforces this by showing a significantly higher frequency of extreme growth years compared to Switzerland.\n",
    "2.  **Inflation Parity:** Interestingly, the t-Test reveals that despite systemic differences, the average inflation pressure in China is not significantly different from the USA. This suggests that global economic forces (e.g., energy prices, trade) affect both superpowers similarly, regardless of their political system."
